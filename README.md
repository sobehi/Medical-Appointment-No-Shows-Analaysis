# Medical-Appointment-No-Shows-Analaysis
This project analyses the factors behind a patient showing up or not showing up for their scheduled appointment after being given all the necessary information required to attend.
# Data Overview
The No show appointment dataset contains information of over 110,000 patients scheduled for appointments. The purpose of the project is to analyse the factors behind a patient showing up or not showing up for their scheduled appointment after being given all the necessary information required to attend. There are 14 columns in the data set containing information about each patient such as the patient's Id, gender, neighbourhood, health conditions etc.

# Question(s) for Analysis
The following questions were proposed for the analysis:

1. What gender has the highest rate of showing up for appointments?  
2. Which neighbourhood has the highest amount of No-shows and the highest amount of shows    
3. Do patients with Scholarships attend more appointments? 
4. Are patients who get sms reminders more likely to show up? 
5. What month has the highest and lowest show up?

# Conclusions
From this analysis, it is observed that more Females show up for appointments with a 65% rate. This implies that more females are more liely to show up for appointments than men.

Both JARDIM CAMBURI and MARIA ORTIZ have the highest numbers of shows and no-shows for appoinment. It may mean that the neighbourhood in which the clinic is located may not really have an impact on whether a patient shows up or not.

Also, we noticed that patients without scholarships showed up for more appointments than those with scholarships. This may result from the fact that there are fewer patients with scholarships which makes it unevenly distributed.

Based on sms received, we can see that most patients showed up for appointments without receiving sms. Also, 3/4 of patients didn't show up for their appointments despite receiving sms. It may be inferred that the receipt of sms does not guarantee showing up for appointments.

Lastly, the month of may actually had more patients show up for appointments. It may be that there are more doctors or patients available during this period, or more weather conditions are more favourable etc. More analysis would need to be done on that.

# Limitation
Limitation of this analysis was not having enough samples of patients who have scholarships, this did not allow for an adequate comparison based on the information provided on scholarships. Also, the information provided abouth health issues/illnesses did not contain enough details regarding the severity of the illness. Hence we couldn't perform any analysis based on that information.
